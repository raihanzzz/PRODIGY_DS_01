## 📊 Output Preview

### 🔹 Bar Chart – Total Population by Country
Displays how population varies across countries in a selected year.

### 🔹 Histogram – Distribution of Population
Shows how population sizes are distributed across countries.

You can find sample charts inside the notebook under the output cells.
