# 📊 Task-01: Population Distribution Visualization

## 🎯 Objective
Visualize the distribution of a continuous variable using a bar chart or histogram.  
In this task, we analyze **World Population** data to display population trends over the years.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this task was sourced from:  
🔗 [World Bank - Total Population Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

📄 Sample file used: `worldpopulationdata.csv`

## 📊 Output Preview

### 🔹 Bar Chart – Total Population by Country
Displays how population varies across countries in a selected year.

### 🔹 Histogram – Distribution of Population
Shows how population sizes are distributed across countries.

You can find sample charts inside the notebook under the output cells.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Population varies significantly across countries.
- Countries like China and India dominate global population counts.
- Histograms help identify most common population brackets.
